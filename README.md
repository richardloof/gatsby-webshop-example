Example app showing how to build a webshop in Gatsby, featuring:
- Programatically creating pages for products fetched from your backend
- Creating a shopping cart in `redux`, persisted between page navigations by
using `redux-persist`

This example is based on the [gatsby-starter-material-ui](https://github.com/nareshbhatia/gatsby-starter-material-ui) in order to get styling for the application.

To run the app simply:

1) Clone the repo
2) `npm install`
3) `npm run develop`
4) Visit localhost:8000 in your browser
